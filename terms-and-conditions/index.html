            <p>
              By accessing and using MicroScan AI, you agree to be bound by
              these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If

            <p>
              Permission is granted for personal use according to your
              subscription plan. This is a grant of a license, not a transfer of
              title. Under this license, you may not:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>
              <li>
                Use the materials for any commercial purpose beyond your
                licensed usage
              </li>
              <li>Remove any copyright or proprietary notations</li>
              <li>Transfer the materials to another person</li>
              <li>"Mirror" the materials on any other server</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
            <p>
              In no event shall MicroScan AI or its suppliers be liable for any
              damages arising from the use or inability to use the application,
              even if MicroScan AI or an authorized representative has been
              informed of the possibility of such damage.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Revisions & Errata</h2>
            <p>
              The materials in the application may include technical,
              typographical, or photographic errors. MicroScan AI does not
              warrant that any of the materials are accurate, complete, or
              current.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Subscription and Payments</h2>
            <p>
              Payment Processing: We use Stripe for payment processing and
              subscription management. Payments can be made on a monthly or
              annual basis according to our published pricing plans.
            </p>

            <h3>Subscription Terms</h3>
            <p>The following terms apply to subscriptions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Free trials are available for new users and are limited to one
                per user. Additional free trials are not permitted.
              </li>
              <li>Monthly subscriptions are billed every 30 days</li>
              <li>Annual subscriptions are billed every 12 months</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
              All payments are final and non-refundable. All payments are final
              and non-refundable, as each interpretation request incurs
              immediate computational costs. However, we prioritize fairness and
              customer satisfaction. If you suspect an error, please contact our
              support team.
            </p>

            <h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
            <p>
              Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24
              hours before the renewal date through your device's subscription
              management settings.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Your use of the application is also governed by our Privacy
              Policy, which can be found in the application settings.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>

              the laws of Romania. Any legal action or proceeding arising out of
              these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Romania.
            </p>
